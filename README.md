# World Cup Machine Learning

## Overview

Models will be built to focus on the following tasks:

* Expected goals: all passes that end in a shot

* Expected possession: all possession for a team

* Pass map: create map visualization of passing trajectory

## Data

All the data for the three models exists in `data/events/19714.json`. `19714` represents one game. The events folder has events for all games. There are corresponding `matches` and `lineups` data sets that tie back to the events. We will focus primarily on `events` for now
