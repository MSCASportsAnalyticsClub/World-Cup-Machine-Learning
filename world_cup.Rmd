# Overview

Models will be built to focus on the following tasks:

* Expected goals: all passes that end in a shot

* Expected possession: all possession for a team

* Pass map

# Data

All the data for the three models exists in `data/events/19714.json`. `19714` represents one game. The events folder has events for all games. There are corresponding `matches` and `lineups` data sets that tie back to the events. We will focus primarily on `events` for now

```{r Data}
events_json <- fromJSON("data/events/19725.json", simplifyVector = FALSE)
```

Parse `events_json` to extract relevant data for **expected goals** model.
```{r Extract-data}
replace_na_empty <- function(x) {
  map_if(x, is.null, ~ NA)
}

event_id <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$id)

type_id <- map_int(events_json, ~ .x$type$id)

type_name <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$type$name)

timestamp <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$timestamp)

possession_team_name <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$possession_team$name)

team_name <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$team$name)

pass_length <- map(events_json, ~ .x$pass$length) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()

pass_height <- map(events_json, ~ .x$pass$height$name) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()

pass_angle <- map(events_json, ~ .x$pass$angle) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()

duration <- map(events_json, ~ .x$duration) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()

play_pattern_name <- map_chr(events_json, ~ .x$play_pattern$name)

goalkeeper_type_name <- map(events_json, ~ .x$goalkeeper$type$name) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()

goalkeeper_outcome_name <- map(events_json, ~ .x$goalkeeper$outcome$name) %>% 
  replace_na_empty() %>% unlist()
```

```{r events-df}
events_df <- data.frame(
    event_id,
    type_id,
    type_name,
    timestamp,
    duration,

    possession_team_name,

  ) %>%
  #' Used to identify sequences; max `FALSE` value is the start of a sequence
  mutate(lead_possessor = possession_team_name == lead(possession_team_name)) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Check index of all shots and then look back to see what lead to a shot.
```{r}
(shot_indexes <- which(str_detect(events_df$type_name, "Shot")))
```

Pass sequences are defined as uninterrupted possession leading to a shot.
```{r pass-sequences}
sequence_indexes <- vector("list", length(shot_indexes))

for (i in seq_along(shot_indexes)) {
  start_index <- ifelse(i == 1, 1, shot_indexes[i - 1] + 2)
  sequence_indexes[[i]] <- seq(start_index, shot_indexes[i] + 1, 1)
}

shots_split <- map(sequence_indexes, ~ events_df %>% slice(min(.x):max(.x)))

start_sequence <- map_int(shots_split, function(x) {
  x <- x %>% mutate(type_name_flag = ifelse(lag(type_name) == "Shot", "remove", "keep"))
  x <- x %>% filter(type_name_flag == "keep")
  #' Check if `FALSE` exist and return max index of `FALSE`
  if (length(which(!x$lead_possessor)) >= 1) {
    as.integer(max(which(!x$lead_possessor)) + 2)
  } else {
      min(x$lead_possessor)
    }
  }
) 

pass_sequences <- map2(shots_split, start_sequence, ~ .x %>% slice(.y:nrow(.x))) %>%
  map2(., 1:length(shots_split), ~ mutate(.x, pass_sequence_label = .y)) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  mutate(
    pass_sequence_label = factor(pass_sequence_label),
    type_name = ifelse(type_name == "Goal Keeper", goalkeeper_type_name, type_name)
  ) %>%
  group_by(pass_sequence_label) %>%
  # Need to account for shots that were block by someone 
  # other than the goal keeper when identifying outcome of shot
  mutate(goals = case_when(
        str_detect(goalkeeper_outcome_name, "Goal Conceded|Penalty Conceded|No Touch|Touched In") ~ "goal conceded",
        str_detect(goalkeeper_type_name, "Shot Faced") & lag(type_name) == "Shot" ~ "missed shot", 
        is.na(goalkeeper_outcome_name) & is.na(goalkeeper_type_name) ~ NA_character_,
        lag(type_name) != "Shot" | is.na(lag(type_name)) ~ NA_character_,
        TRUE ~ "saved"
  ))

pass_sequences %>% 
  select(pass_sequence_label, type_name, goalkeeper_outcome_name, goals) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(goals)) %>% 
  distinct(pass_sequence_label, goals)
```

```{r Show-data}
